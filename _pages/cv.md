## About Me

I build engineering organizations that deliver measurable business outcomes &mdash;
not by accident, but by design. I believe in value-stream aligned teams where engineers
own their products and understand the business they operate in, rather than working as
passive order-takers. My teams are consistently highly engaged, care deeply about their
customers, and it shows in their results.

I'm T-shaped: comfortable leading organizations of 30+ engineers, diving deep into
architecture and code, building platforms, designing systems, and working cross-functionally
with product, operations, and executives. I've been employee 30 at a pre-Series A startup
that was acquired by Microsoft, built the business intelligence that powered fundraising,
and scaled engineering organizations that underpin hundreds of millions in annual recurring
revenue.

I'm also an active builder &mdash; I stay technical through experimentation, open-source
contributions, and voracious reading. I'm particularly excited about applied AI and
platform engineering: I believe agentic AI will be transformative for how we build software,
and that strong engineering platforms become more important, not less, in the AI age.
